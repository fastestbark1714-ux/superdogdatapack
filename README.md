🐺 How to Install the Super Dog Datapack in Minecraft (1.21.8)

Download the ZIP file (the datapack).

Open your Minecraft world save folder:

Press Win + R → type %appdata% → go to .minecraft/saves/YourWorldName/.

On Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves/YourWorldName/

Inside your world folder, open the datapacks folder.

Drop the UNZIP file directly inside the datapacks folder.
(unzip it — Minecraft reads the ZIP automatically)

Launch Minecraft → load the world.

Run /reload in chat to activate the datapack.

Summon your dog with:

/function superdog:summon


That’s it! Your unkillable Super Dog is ready. 🐺🔥
